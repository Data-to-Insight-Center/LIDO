        "description": "Traffic-control devices are integral to driver-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions. The non-conformation with (or nonperception of) signage by the driver leads to several compounded safety problems. The need exists for a more robust, low-cost, and user-centric mechanism of delivering information to the driver that can directly bear on safety. Technology has now advanced to the point where we can deliver information from a real-world physical environment to the driver in a noninvasive manner using holographic display [1]. With this rapid advancement in in-vehicle display technology, the transportation industry must undergo a transition period before entering the world of connected and autonomous vehicles. Here, the integration of in-vehicle display will play major role. The advantage is the level of flexibility and control offered by a dynamic in-vehicle display that allows us to provide very specific traffic-control information to the driver at situations and times deemed appropriate. The research questions will be focused on how such safety-critical traffic-control information, and what specific information, can be delivered effectively to the driver using a dynamic in-vehicle display without causing any form of distraction or engagement-related problems. Vehicles exceeding the posted speed limit present an optimal application. With regard to the hierarchy of traffic-control devices, there is an urgent need for drivers to comply with speed limits. According to NHTSA, 26% of traffic fatalities in 2017 resulted from crashes where at least one of the drivers was speeding [2]. In addition, the act of unintentional speeding has been identified in research as the most frequent driving violation [3]. This forms the primary objective, which is to investigate driver behavior and compliance with invehicle display speed alerts. This research investigates the characteristics of visual cues that minimize the driver’s perception time without adding to redundant visual clutter and at the same time accounting for the safety aspects required in a driving environment. This research endeavor evaluated drivers in a controlled environment using a full-scale driving simulator with active invehicle displays and eye-tracking equipment. The experiment investigated driving parameters such as head and eye movements, vehicle-handling measures, task-engagement behaviors, and physiological parameters. Ultimately, the goal of this study was to understand driver-sign compliance with the implementation of an in-vehicle display in the driving-simulator environment. The results were helpful in gaining a better understanding of drivers’ responsiveness depending on the nature of the cue. (2019-04-01)",
